#### INTRODUCTION
Cool project, it was a section about Twitter API in course and i didn't know what to do so i decided i am gonna use my new skills to do something useful. Printing last 30 tweets of Eminem, because i love Eminem, but i don't use Twitter. Project heavily inspired by one of projects from course "Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.

#### DESCRIPTION
Using Twitter API (tweepy) to get access to Twitter content. Printing 30 tweets, possibility of writing them to .txt file or sending them as email. Did that just to explore new features of language.

#### USED TECHNOLOGIES
Python

#### HOW TO
Get Tweepy API keys at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api, then put them in lines 14-18 (OAuthHandler1, OAuthHandler2, access_token1, access_token2). Then run `py main.py`. Tweets should be printed at console. You can change profile at line 26 (id="Eminem") from which tweets will be taken. Actually you can save them as txt or send them as email. Uncomment lines 51-78. If you wanna save them as txt run `py main.py txt`. If you wanna send them as email, change emails, password, host and port. Then `py main.py email`
