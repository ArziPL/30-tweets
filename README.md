# 30-tweets

#### Technologies
Python

#### Description
Getting last 30 tweets from Eminem using Twitter API, because why not ? I did the app because i love Eminem and in Poland we really don't use Twitter at all, so i needed to find a way to keep track of his things. If you wanna check out app you will need create account on Twitter and ask for Twitter Developer API keys, then past them into code. You can as well change ID on line 26 to anybody you want.

#### Bugs 
Not much i guess
