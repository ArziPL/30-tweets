# 30-tweets
***
### Description
Python script showing last 30 tweets from Eminem. Point of app is that i am not really using Twitter but i love Eminem so i want to be up to date with his things.

### How to
You need to get your Twitter API keys, then paste them (lines 14-18). Then just run 'py main.py'. It's gonna show last 30 tweets from Eminem. You can as well change id='Eminem' on line 26 to any id that is on Twitter, then you should get last 30 tweets of that person.

### Rest
On bottom of main.py there is a lot of commented code. There are two other options to get those tweets. Actually you can save them as txt or send them as email. Uncomment lines 51-78. If you wanna save them as txt run 'py main.py txt'. If you wanna send them as email, change emails, password, host and port. Then 'py main.py email'.
