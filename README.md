### DESCRIPTION
Aim of project :  
Practice Python, test Twitter API. I love Eminem, but I don't use Twitter so i did script that prints all of his tweets.


Description :  
Straightforward, make call to API, get response, print response. On the bottom of script there are lines commented out, if you want you can save tweets to .txt, or send them as email (some work needed to do that). If you want you can change id at line 26 to get anyone tweets and change tweet_counter at 32 to change number of tweets.

ToDo :  
- **finished**
