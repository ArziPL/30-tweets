### DESCRIPTION

I love Eminem, but I don't use Twitter so i did script that prints all of his tweets. Make call to API, get response, print response. On the bottom of script there are lines commented out, if you want you can save tweets to .txt, or send them as email (some work needed to do that). If you want you can change id at line 26 to get anyone tweets and change tweet_counter at 32 to change number of tweets.

Get your API keys at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api and past them here at lines 14-18 :

15                            OAuthHandler2)      <-- here
16 auth.set_access_token(access_token1,           <-- here
17                       access_token2)           <-- here

Just do that, you should see tweets in console
