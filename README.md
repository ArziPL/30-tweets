# 30-tweets
***
### DESCRIPTION
Python script (Tweepy, Twitter API) showing last 30 tweets from Eminem. Point of app is that i am not really using Twitter but i love Eminem so i want to be up to date with his things. On bottom of main.py there is a lot of commented code. There are two other options to get those tweets. Actually you can save them as txt or send them as email. Uncomment lines 51-78. If you wanna save them as txt run `py main.py txt`. If you wanna send them as email, change emails, password, host and port. Then `py main.py email`. Project heavily inspired by one of projects from course "Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.

### HOW TO
You need to get your Twitter API keys, then paste them (lines 14-18). Then just run `py main.py`. It's gonna show last 30 tweets from Eminem. You can as well change id='Eminem' on line 26 to any id that is on Twitter, then you should get last 30 tweets of that person.
